# HPS

A C++11 High Performance Serialization Library.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jl2922/hps.svg?branch=master&style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/jl2922/hps)

## Overview

HPS is a high performance header-only C++11 library for data serialization.
It can encode structured data or objects into a flat and compressed format efficiently, so that we can pass them over the network or write them to the file system faster, or store them more compactly in the memory.

It has the **state of the art performance** and beats all the well-known serialization libraries.
For example, comparing to Boost Serialization, HPS is up to 250% faster and uses up to 35% less bytes for several common data structures.
Check the benchmarks below for details.

In addition, it requires the least amount of human efforts to use.
There is **no need for a separate schema file or special data structures**, HPS works with STL containers and user-defined types directly.
This design reduces the cognitive efforts for programmers and makes the binding of data and methods more cohesive.

## Installation

Not needed!
HPS is a header-only library.
Simply include the `hps.h` file, which includes all the other headers.

## Benchmark

The performance of HPS compared to other well-known C++ serializers for some most common data structures are as follows: (less is better)

The test codes are in the [benchmark](https://github.com/jl2922/hps/tree/master/src/benchmark) directory.
You can follow the continuous integration script in [ci.sh](https://github.com/jl2922/hps/tree/master/ci.sh) to install the libraries and reproduce these results.

The sparse matrix is stored as a list of rows, each of which contains a list of 64-bit integers for the column indices and a list of doubles for the values.
The hash map is a map from strings to doubles.
Both HPS and Boost can serialize `std::unordered_map` directly, ProtoBuf uses its own Map type and CapnProto does not support hash map or similar types.

In addition to the traditional benchmarks for computational cost, we also provide the human efforts cost in terms of source lines of code for these test cases: (less is better)

| SLOC | double array | sparse matrix | hash map | fixed cost |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **protobuf** | 12 | 23 | 12 | 17 |
| **capnproto** | 15 | 25 | - | 21 |
| **boost** | 13 | 20 | 13 | 13 |
| **hps** | 7 | 16 | 7 | 2 |

Note: fixed cost includes the estimated amount of lines of commands needed for an experienced user to install the library, set the environment variables, extra lines of code needed in the Makefile, and various includes, etc.

## Usage

HPS is super easy to use.
For primitive types and most STL containers, serialization requires only one line of code.

```c++
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include "../src/hps.h"

int main() {
  std::vector<int> data({22, 333, -4444});

  std::string serialized = hps::to_string(data);
  auto parsed = hps::from_string<std::vector<int>>(serialized);

  assert(parsed == data);

  std::cout << "size (B): " << serialized.size() << std::endl;
  // size (B): 6

  return 0;
}
// Compile with C++11 or above.
```

There are also the `to_stream` and `from_stream` functions for writing the data to or reading it from file streams.
For example
```c++
std::ofstream out_file("data.log", std::ofstream::binary);
hps::to_stream(data, out_file);
std::ifstream in_file("data.log", std::ifstream::binary);
auto parsed = hps::from_stream<std::vector<int>>(in_file);
```
The bottom of this document contains all the APIs that HPS provides.

We can also extend HPS to support custom types.
HPS internally uses static polymorphism on the class `Serializer<DataType, BufferType>` to support different types.
`Serializer<DataType, BufferType>` will call the `serialize` and `parse` methods of the corresponding type by default.
All we need to do is either provide the `serialize` and `parse` methods for the new type or specialize the `Serializer` class, and HPS will support it, together with any combination of this type with STL containers and other specialized types.

The following example shows the serialization of a custom quantum system object by providing its `serialize` and `parse` methods.

```c++
#include <cassert>
#include <iostream>
#include "../src/hps.h"

class QuantumState {
 public:
  unsigned n_elecs;
  std::unordered_set<unsigned> orbs_from;
  std::unordered_set<unsigned> orbs_to;

  template <class B>
  void serialize(B& buf) const {
    buf << n_elecs << orbs_from << orbs_to;
  }

  template <class B>
  void parse(B& buf) {
    buf >> n_elecs >> orbs_from >> orbs_to;
  }
};

int main() {
  QuantumState qs;

  qs.n_elecs = 33;
  qs.orbs_from.insert({11, 22});
  qs.orbs_to.insert({44, 66});

  std::string serialized = hps::to_string(qs);

  std::cout << "size (B): " << serialized.size() << std::endl;
  // size (B): 7

  return 0;
}
// Compile with C++11 or above.
```

For examples on extending HPS by specializing the `Serializer` class, you can check our source code for primitive types and STL containers, such as [float_serializer.h](https://github.com/jl2922/hps/blob/master/src/basic_type/float_serializer.h), where we specialize the `Serializer` for all the floating point numbers (using `SFINAE`).
Note that specializing the `Serializer` class is the only choice if you do not have control over the new type.

## Encoding Scheme

The encoding scheme of HPS is very similar to Google's protobuf.
Google provides an [extremely detailed exlanation](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/encoding) on that.

The major difference between protobuf's encoding scheme and HPS' is that the **field numbers or wire types are not stored**.
Messages are always serialized and parsed in the same order.
This gives HPS a significant advantage in both the speed and the size of the serialized messages over protobuf on data with small nested structures.

## API Reference

```c++
// Serialize data t to an STL ostream.
void to_stream(const T& t, std::ostream& stream);
```
```c++
// Parse from an STL istream and save to the data t passed in.
// Recommended for repeated use inside a loop.
void from_stream(T& t, std::istream& stream);
```
```c++
// Parse from an STL istream and return the data.
T from_stream<T>(std::istream& stream);
```
```c++
// Serialize data t to the STL string passed in.
// Recommended for repeated use inside a loop.
void to_string(const T& t, std::string& str);
```
```c++
// Serialize data t to an STL string and return it.
std::string to_string(const T& t);
```
```c++
// Parse from an STL string and save to the data t passed in.
// Recommended for repeated use inside a loop.
void from_string(T& t, const std::string& str);
```
```c++
// Parse from an STL string and return the data.
T from_string<T>(const std::string& str);
```
```c++
// Parse from a char array and save to the data t passed in.
// Recommended for repeated use inside a loop.
void from_char_array(T& t, const char* arr);
```
```c++
// Parse from a char array and return the data.
T from_char_array<T>(const char* arr);
```

HPS supports the following types and any combinations of them out of the box:

* All primitive numeric types, a.k.a. `std::is_arithmetic<T>`, e.g. `int, double, bool, char, uint8_t, size_t, ...`
* STL containers `string, array, deque, list, map, unordered_map, set, unordered_set, pair, vector, unique_ptr`.

## Tips for Heterogeneous Data

Heterogeneous data here refer messages that contain data structures that occur repeatedly and have some fields in them missing irregularly in different instances of the structure.

There is no panacea for achieving the best performance for this type of data in all cases.

Protobuf uses an additional integer to indicate the existence of each field, which is best suitable for cases where there are lots of fields and most of them are missing.

Another possible encoding scheme is bit representation, i.e., use a bit vector to indicate the existence of the fields.
This is best suitable for cases where there are not many fields and fields are missing less often.
There is no need to deal with bit operations directly.
An STL `vector<bool>` will use a compact format automatically, i.e., eight booleans in a byte, and same for the HPS serialized version.

And for cases where most of the fields seldom have missing values, the reverse of protobuf's scheme may be the best choice, i.e., use a vector to store the indices of the missing fields.
